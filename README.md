| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß† **Multiple AI Agents**    | Switch between seven different AI algorithms, from simple heuristics like Greedy Best-First Search to complex pathfinding like A*.       |
| üìä **Real-Time Visualization** | Watch the AI's "thought process" in real-time as it explores the game board, providing a clear visual understanding of how each algorithm works. |
| üïπÔ∏è **Full Joystick Support** | Play the game or navigate all menus using a standard joystick, in addition to keyboard controls.                                         |
| üßë‚Äçüíª **Human Playable Mode**   | Take control yourself and try to beat the high scores in a classic, polished Snake experience.                                            |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Difficulty** | Adjust the game speed across four difficulty levels to provide a challenge for both human players and the AI agents.                     |
| üèÜ **Persistent High Scores**  | Your best scores for each difficulty level are saved and displayed, encouraging replayability.                                          |
| üé® **Polished UI/UX**          | A clean and intuitive user interface with a full main menu, level selection, and in-game pause functionality.                          |

  ### AI Play Algorithms
  * **Online Search (Reinforcement Learning with Danger/Success Memory):** This agent learns by experience, remembering dangerous locations and successful paths. It uses a custom heuristic incorporating learned danger to guide its decisions, dynamically adapting to the game environment.
  * **A* Search (with Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment):** Employs the A* search algorithm with Manhattan distance as the heuristic. To manage search complexity and adapt to the game's dynamics, it incorporates a DFS component.
  * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** A systematic algorithm that guarantees finding the shortest path to the food but can be computationally expensive.
  * **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores a single branch as deeply as possible before backtracking. While potentially faster than BFS, it doesn't guarantee finding the shortest path.
  * **Greedy Best-First Search:** A heuristic-driven approach that prioritizes the move seemingly closest to the food, which can miss optimal solutions.
  * **Hamiltonian Cycle (Demonstration):** A deterministic approach following a pre-calculated path that visits every grid cell exactly once.

  ### AI Vision Algorithms (Visualization)
  * These algorithms focus on visualizing the search process itself, providing insights into how different strategies explore the game board to find a path to the food for A*, BFS, DFS, Greedy, and Online Search.

## Description

Briefly describe the performance issue you've encountered or the new algorithm you're proposing.

## Context (For Performance Issues)

If you're reporting a performance issue, please provide the following context:

*   **Algorithm:** Which algorithm are you experiencing the issue with (e.g., A*, BFS, DFS, Online Search, Greedy)?
*   **Scenario:** Describe the specific scenario in which the issue occurs (e.g., specific map/grid configuration, snake length, food position).
*   **Expected Behavior:** What performance did you expect to see?
*   **Actual Behavior:** What performance did you actually observe?
*   **Measurements:** If possible, provide quantitative measurements of the performance issue (e.g., execution time, number of nodes expanded, memory usage). You can use the provided `Experiment` file to make your measurements.

## Proposed Solution (If Applicable)

If you have an idea for how to improve the algorithm's performance, please describe it here.

## New Algorithm Proposal (If Applicable)

If you're proposing a new algorithm, please provide the following information:

*   **Algorithm Name:**
*   **Description:** Explain how the algorithm works, its strengths and weaknesses, and its potential advantages over existing algorithms.
*   **Pseudocode (Optional):** Provide pseudocode to illustrate the algorithm's logic.
*   **Implementation (Optional):** If you have a preliminary implementation, you can share a link to it (e.g., a GitHub Gist or a branch in your forked repository).
*   **Expected Performance:** Describe the expected performance characteristics of the new algorithm (e.g., time complexity, space complexity).

## Environment

*   **Operating System:** (e.g., Windows 10, macOS 13, Ubuntu 20.04)
*   **Python Version:** (e.g., 3.9, 3.10)
*   **Pygame Version:** (If applicable, the version of Pygame you are using)
*   **Hardware:** (Optional, but helpful for performance issues: CPU, RAM)
